# subtitling
some stuff to read when nothing you hear makes sense

## huh?
Subtitles for various Japanese works, mainly all-ages ASMR audio. Yeah, like hell I'm doing any translations of NSFW ASMR. All subtitles are in `.srt` format, which is more than 100% compatible with all video players on desktop or phone.

  <summary>what subtitles do you have? (click to expand)</summary>

- Blue Archive ASMR
  - Volume Hina
  - Volume Kayoko (not yet, but I'm pumped to work on this)
- nothing else, yet

If there are no official subtitles included with releases, then I will also provide the cleaned up Whisper `.srt` outputs. Eventually.
