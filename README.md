# subtitling
some stuff to read when nothing you hear makes sense

## huh?
Subtitles for various Japanese works, mainly all-ages ASMR audio, and occasionally some lewd but not entirely explicit audio. All subtitles are in `.srt` format, which is more than 100% compatible with all video players on desktop or phone.

  <summary>what subtitles do you have? or will have? (click to expand)</summary>

- Blue Archive ASMR
  - Volume Hina
  - Volume Kayoko (not yet, but I'm pumped to work on this)
- Koichoco Hazuki-sensei Drama CD
- A〇kana Drama CD 2 (Misaki tracks only)
- Realive Sofmap Drama CD

I will likely not be providing the original Japanese transcription for various reasons.

[Gemini](https://github.com/openai/whisper) — the very neat transcribing method that patches the holes in my virtually non-existent jp speaking comprehension, plus rough timings for SRT files

[OpenAI/Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) — ditto, but what I used previously

[Aegisub](https://aegisub.org/) — subtitle creation and editing tool to change text and to fix the jank timings output by the transcription method

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) — for running Whisper on because my bum-ass laptop doesn't like running it nicely

[Groq](https://groq.com) — Works faster and sometimes better than running Whisper on Colab.
