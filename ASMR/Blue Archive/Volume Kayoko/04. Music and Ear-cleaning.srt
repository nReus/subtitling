1
00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:04,421
Thanks for the shower, Sensei.

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:10,344
Even though it wasn't a thorough cleaning, things still get a bit dusty after tidying up.

3 
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,130
Yeah, it feels refreshing.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,600
Oh, I also borrowed a hairdryer and an ear pick.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,981
Yeah. Since we have such good audio equipment,

6
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,460
it's best to listen to the great sound it produces

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,920
in optimal conditions, right?

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,680
So hey, why don't you let me clean your ears too, Sensei?

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:44,060
Oh, no, I phrased that poorly.

10
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,960
No, it's fine if you don't want me to, but I don't mind doing it for you.

11
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,480
Alright then, I'll do it.

12
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,620
Um, how should we do this?

13
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,120
I guess you could lay a towel over my lap?

14
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,321
Nevermind, it's okay.

15  
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,492
Let's just use that sofa.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Please, go ahead.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,260
It feels a bit weird, doesn't it?

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,974
Well, seeing your face up this close is an unusual experience.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,647
Ah, anyway I have the ear pick and cotton buds ready.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,640
What?

21
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,100
Do you enjoy this intimidating look on my face?

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,260 
Don't say anything weird, I might slip up.

23
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,580
Actually, I can't clean your ears if you're looking up, 

24
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,551
so could you turn your head and face that way instead?

25
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,390
Okay, shall we begin?

26  
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,350
I'll be gentle, but let me know if it hurts at all.

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,490
It might tickle, so try not to move too much.

28
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,085
It's pretty clean, so I don't need to dig too hard.

29
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,590  
Let me start with the outer grooves first,

30
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,860
slowly and carefully.

31
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:09,000
Scritch, scritch.

32
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,000  
How's that?

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,480
No pain or weird sensations?

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,220
Good, I'm glad.

35
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,484
Okay, going a bit deeper now.

36
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,160
If you feel like sneezing or moving, let me know right away.

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Cleaning like this.

38
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:31,813
Trying not to scrape the inner walls too much,

39  
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,276
don't want to irritate the membranes.

40
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,532
I won't go too deep since earwax naturally comes out on its own.

41
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:49,200
Besides, it serves a protective function in moderation.

42
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:56,325
So I'll be careful not to disrupt that process too much.

43
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:30,875
Alright, I think that ear is clean now.

44
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,225  
How does it feel? Any weird sensations or problem areas?

45
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If it's all good, I'll use the cotton buds to finish up.

46
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay, here goes.

47
00:06:06,175 --> 00:06:10,000 
Hm? No, it's nothing.

48
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Well, Mutsuki and the others act silly and clingy sometimes, so I guess during moments like that.

49
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,325
With the President and Haruka though...

50  
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:31,475
I mean, they might tease me after seeing me do this for Mutsuki, 

51
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:36,150
but I don't really do it for them.

52
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,985
So I'm just used to it, I guess.

53
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:49,659
Right now I'm just being careful, that's probably why it seems that way.

54
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:52,500
The feeling?

55
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,000 
Well, that's good then.

56
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,975
They say there's something called the vagus nerve.

57
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,425
Stimulating that area can induce pleasurable sensations.

58
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:11,139
For some people it might even trigger coughing reflex.

59 
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:18,521
Since it involves nerve stimulation, you don't want to overdo it of course.

60
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,800
But a little bit more won't hurt.

61
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,297
Okay, looks good.

62
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:53,450
Oh, are you alright?

63
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:56,825 
Just startled? 

64
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,950
Sorry, I should have warned you first.

65
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:03,700  
What's wrong?

66
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,112
If you're okay then.

67
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:09,698
Let me try again.

68
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,959
There, that side is done.

69  
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,044
Could you turn the other way?

70
00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:29,000
Really, it's fine.

71
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,553
Your face is flushed though, Sensei.

72
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:36,516
Nevermind that.

73  
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:44,600
Okay, I'm inserting the pick again, so stay still.

74
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,674
Need to get this ear just as clean as the other.

75
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:16,973
Calling it purification might be going overboard, 

76
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,100  
but don't you have rituals like that, Sensei?

77
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,816
Like when you get a new CD you've been anticipating,

78
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:32,197
you clean your room, take a shower,

79
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:37,525
and get everything ready before really sitting down to enjoy it?

80
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,206
Video games?

81
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,000
Ah, I see.

82
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:52,801
Well, I don't play much, but it's a similar feeling.

83
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,425
Music is mainly experienced through the ears,

84
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:04,200
so you want them to be clean, makes sense.

85
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:11,000  
Not that you need me to explain, but

86
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:22,800
basically, sound works by the eardrum sensing air vibrations in the inner ear, 

87
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:26,543
which has an intricate structure,

88
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,775
evolved to capture all the nuances artists labor over

89
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:38,300
when creating their work through constant refinement.

90
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,450
And audio equipment goes through similar iteration  

91
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,106
to reproduce that sound

92
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,250 
as faithfully as possible.

93
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,475
So in a way, maintaining good listening conditions

94
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
is just part of making an effort to properly appreciate the art.

95  
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:09,425
More of a mindset than pragmatic necessity, I suppose.

96
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,880
But one I try to uphold nonetheless.

97
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,100
Ah, sorry for rambling.

98
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:25,518
My apologies, I tend to go on about this stuff.

99
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,897
Um...

100
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,775
Okay, looking good.  

101
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:42,530
Now for the cotton buds.

102
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:49,000
This side okay too? Not ticklish?

103
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,800
Good, that's a relief.

104  
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,371
I suppose so.

105
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,228
Well, rambling isn't exactly my strong suit, but I do tend to go into detail.

106
00:12:40,171 --> 00:12:45,000
There are enough chatterboxes in our group as is.

107  
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:53,485
Yeah, I may not be an expert, but I do enjoy learning about audio gear

108
00:12:54,285 --> 00:13:01,257 
and the technical side of music production. Comes with the territory, I guess.

109
00:13:02,371 --> 00:13:09,000
Though I doubt my knowledge goes much deeper than any other enthusiast's.

110  
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:15,461
No need for compliments, really.

111
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,085
Even with our...lifestyle choices,

112
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:29,714
we all study plenty hard when it counts.  

113
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:36,941
The President was getting tutoring from you recently, right Sensei?

114
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:42,971
Though she'd rather focus on business management and such.

115  
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:50,485
Mutsuki could ace everything if she applied herself instead of wasting time.

116
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:57,371
Haruka is knowledgeable about botany and the like too.  

117
00:14:00,114 --> 00:14:05,514
If you're interested, maybe you could teach a class for us four?

118  
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
No pressure of course.

119
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:18,114
We know you're busy, I'm just suggesting it casually.

120 
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,771
Don't worry about it.

121
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,428  
I got sidetracked there for a bit,

122
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,571
but I've been focused this whole time, promise.

123
00:14:34,057 --> 00:14:43,800
Scritch, scritch, scritch.

124 
00:15:06,314 --> 00:15:10,326
Okay, I think we got all the wax out.

125
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:14,171  
Right, then.

126
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,914
Actually, am I being too rough?

127
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:32,085
But it you don't seem to be in pain, so I'll keep at it gently.

128  
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:37,628
Just try not to move too suddenly, you'll startle me.

129
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:55,371
I think we're good to go.

130
00:15:56,742 --> 00:16:00,628
Both ears seem nice and clean now. How do they feel?

131
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
No weird sensations or pain anywhere?

132
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:09,600
That's a relief then.

133
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:13,542
Don't worry about it.

134
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,628
Just my way of returning the many favors.
