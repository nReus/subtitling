1
00:00:02,977 --> 00:00:05,964
Sensei, I borrowed a towel.

2
00:00:06,755 --> 00:00:09,384
Are there any towels I shouldn't borrow?

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,887
Is it okay to use any of them?

4
00:00:13,022 --> 00:00:15,265
Okay, got it.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,960
Ah, geez.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,040
Here Sensei, wipe your head before dealing with the paperwork.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,614
It'd be troublesome if you got it wet with water.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,160
Stay still.

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,501
Sorry, you got pretty soaked.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:52,040
Ah well, I didn't expect a tank to come rolling up right in front of Schale at the very end though.

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,472
It's my fault for not being able to protect you.

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,000
You were totally drenched.

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,080
Are you okay?

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,000
Ah, really?

15
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:12,733
Well, Haruka and the President often come back soaking wet.

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,203
And Mutsuki loves pulling silly stunts like this.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,834
So in that sense, I might just be used to it by now.

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,600
Look down for me please.

19
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,485
Gently...

20
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,400
Well, I guess that's about it there.

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,280
Could you turn your head a bit to the left?

22
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,280
Ah, your ear is wet inside too. Hold still.

23
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,640
By the way, were you planning to work like that, Sensei?

24
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,474
Why don't you go change instead?

25
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,440
No, not air drying.

26
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,200
If you do that, you'll catch a cold for sure.

27
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,320
With how careless you are, I'm surprised you don't get sick more often.

28
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,600
Sensei, are you quite the lazy one?

29
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,280
Did you used to hide it better when we first met?

30
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,080
Well, I guess you're dry now at least.

31
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:49,520
But being slovenly isn't good.

32
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm not saying you have to live completely neatly,

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
but if something is preventable, shouldn't you try to prevent it?

34
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,488
Well, considering how the Problem Solvers live,

35
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,795
it's not really my place to say that, is it?

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,080
Show me your other ear.

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,275
Hmm, looks okay.

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,733
Okay, turn the other way.

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,075
This side too...

40
00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:50,000
Excuse me Sensei, could you wait a moment?

41
00:04:53,904 --> 00:04:55,264
I'll borrow this.

42
00:04:58,336 --> 00:04:59,744
Here, have a seat.

43
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:04,720
Yeah, this will be easier.

44
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:10,477
Alright, let me try again.

45
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,400
Ah, I just realized, whose turn is it for Schale duty today?

46
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,000
Hmm, I see.

47
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:50,000
Ah, no, nevermind.

48
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm not really in a position to comment on that system.

49
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:57,000
Then I guess it worked out conveniently.

50
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,111
No, since I came by unexpectedly,

51
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:06,088
I thought it might be a bit awkward to cross paths

52
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,711
with whoever was actually on duty.

53
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,822
It saves me from having to worry about that.

54
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:19,000
All right, I think that's about it.

55
00:06:19,955 --> 00:06:22,177
Your hair should be fine too?

56
00:06:31,377 --> 00:06:33,177
It looks okay.

57
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,000
Ah, my bad.

58
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Ah no, I kind of ended up petting your head there.

59
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Ah, but it's weird for me to apologize too.

60
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,911
Don't worry about it.

61
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,200
Uh, don't you have work to do, Sensei?

62
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah, it's fine.

63
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,222
I came here on my own accord today after all.

64
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,466
Is there any work I can help out with?

65
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,000
I see.

66
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:14,000
Well, at least you're not swamped then.

67
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,733
If there's anything else you need help with besides work, I can do that.

68
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:26,666
Did you just start to say something and stop?

69
00:07:28,111 --> 00:07:30,266
Cleaning is fine by me.

70
00:07:30,688 --> 00:07:33,222
I don't mind tidying up.

71
00:07:34,511 --> 00:07:36,688
No, you can see for yourself.

72
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,355
Before I could even think "there's nothing here",

73
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,177
your gaze went towards the back.

74
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,311
Not to mention, the state of this room...

75
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,888
What happened here?

76
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:52,622
A week...

77
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,355
Or maybe even a few weeks without cleaning, it seems.

78
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,244
Well, I guess it can end up like this if you've been away at a far school.

79
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,266
For now, I'll clean up while you work, Sensei.

80
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,777
I thought about using a vacuum,

81
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,644
but the condition of the place doesn't really allow for that right now.

82
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,716
Then... First I'll throw away the trash,

83
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,222
pick up the clothes for laundry, and dust things off.

84
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,288
And then...

85
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll be washing clothes, but is there anything you don't want me touching?

86
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay.

87
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Then I'll take care of everything.

88
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,244
Don't worry, I won't throw anything away on my own.

89
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll ask if I'm unsure.

90
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:57,111
Ah, but I can throw away those trash bags over there, right?

91
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,688
Understood.

92
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,400
Alright, let's get started then.

93
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,955
I'll take it all out to the hallway first.

94
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,493
Hmm, can't really wash this.

95
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,714
I'll just set it aside for now.

96
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,429
Should I just wash the inner clothes?

97
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,542
Here we go.

98
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,257
Let's see...

99
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay.

100
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,030
I was thinking of taking everything out, but

101
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,566
Ah, don't worry about it.

102
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,666
I planned to dust from the top down, then do the floor,

103
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,566
but it might make the whole room dusty

104
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:36,052
while you're trying to work.

105
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:41,000
For today, I'll just tidy up and do some light cleaning.

106
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:44,866
Is it okay if I dust around your desk area?

107
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:48,633
Understood, got it.

108
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,766
Let me know if anything concerns you.

109
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,960
Alright...

110
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,280
Okay...

111
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,760
Heave-ho.

112
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,800
And...

113
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,766
This one too.

114
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,720
Hmm...

115
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,320
Hup.

116
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
There...

117
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Now then.

118
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,780
Let's see...

119
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,740
Put this back.

120
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,500
And then the vacuum...

121
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Found it.

122
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,680
Umm...

123
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,920
The switch is...

124
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yep.

125
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
This noise level should be fine.

126
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,660
Heave-ho.

127
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,280
Phew.

128
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,000
Next is...

129
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,420
Should I clean the path?

130
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,620
Gently.

131
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,800
I'll be vacuuming again.

132
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:11,000
What are you writing?

133
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Umm...

134
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And then...

135
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,180
That should be okay.

136
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:09,472
Huh, what's this?

137
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:14,752
Wow...

138
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,528
Ah!

139
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,421
You startled me.

140
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,466
Sorry, I didn't notice you there.

141
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,470
Oh, yeah.

142
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,404
I finished cleaning up.

143
00:16:51,848 --> 00:16:54,542
Well, just this room, but still.

144
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:57,022
Should I clean the other rooms too?

145
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,231
You're right, it'd be neverending if I tried tackling everything.

146
00:17:06,213 --> 00:17:09,111
I brought the clothes over to that area.

147
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,826
I washed what seemed okay and put that in the laundry.

148
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,857
For items that didn't seem machine-washable,

149
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:18,568
I just hung them up on hangers for now.

150
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,360
The copier was out of paper,

151
00:17:21,546 --> 00:17:24,417
so I reloaded it from the spare stash.

152
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,182
The whiteboard markers and such,

153
00:17:27,324 --> 00:17:30,275
and other consumables still seem fine.

154
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:33,297
It's nothing.

155
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,688
You don't need to thank me for it.

156
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,800
I'm the one imposing by staying here.

157
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,840
Oh, and this...

158
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:44,604
Did you get this recently?

159
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:47,973
Nice speaker system.

160
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm not too savvy with equipment,

161
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:52,590
but it looks pretty good to me.

162
00:17:55,182 --> 00:17:56,542
I can give it a try?

163
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,300
Ah, but I don't have any CDs with me right now.

164
00:18:00,302 --> 00:18:02,906
Should I use one of yours, Sensei?

165
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:08,125
Oh, the one you mentioned before?

166
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,577
So you did end up getting it too, huh?

167
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:15,600
I see.

168
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:18,000
Then let's use that.

169
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,685
By the way Sensei,

170
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:25,554
have you reached a good stopping point with your work?

171
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:28,651
I see.

172
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:29,805
Good work.

173
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:34,617
Well, your work never really ends, does it?

174
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,000
But maybe you should take a little break.

175
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:42,800
Ah...

176
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:45,942
But if that's the case,

177
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,634
could you wait just a moment?
