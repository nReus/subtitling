1
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,220
Sorry for the wait, Sensei.

2
00:00:13,856 --> 00:00:16,880
Ah, no, you aren't. [*being a bother]

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,904
You don't have to look so worried.

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,616
At least you didn't get caught in the rain.

5
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,586
I'm guessing you were probably out enjoying some sweet treats somewhere.

6
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,586
A lot of the girls here don't like the rain.

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:40,360
Well, at least it wasn't a situation where you were stuck and couldn't leave.

8
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:44,026
You were eating the snacks I brought last time, so

9
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,297
it's not like you didn't come back at all.

10
00:00:48,626 --> 00:00:51,680
Though constantly worrying about food

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,000
might not be the best approach.

12
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:58,934
Yeah, thank you.

13
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:04,030
That's right, she can be quite whimsical at times.

14
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:06,400
I'm sure she's fine, though.

15
00:01:06,786 --> 00:01:11,280
I think she's capable of thinking for herself and moving freely.

16
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:14,773
Ah, this?

17
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,453
Just the trash from an empty can.

18
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,693
Since I was the one who brought it,

19
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,906
I couldn't just leave it lying around.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ah, thank you. It's not heavy or anything.

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,640
Yeah, shall we get going then?

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,960
It doesn't look like the rain will stop anytime soon,

23
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,210
but there's no point in just waiting here,

24
00:01:42,213 --> 00:01:44,960
I'm sure you have things to do, Sensei.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,735
Come on, let's go, Sensei.

26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,777
You're quite forgetful, aren't you, Sensei?

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,177
No, I don't mean there's something specific you've forgotten that I want you to remember.

28
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:21,683
I just feel like you forget your umbrella fairly often.

29
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:27,577
Or maybe you do it on purpose?

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,530
Sorry, don't worry about what I just said.

31
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,560
No, it's fine for me, but

32
00:02:38,555 --> 00:02:41,670
this umbrella is quite large for a folding one.

33
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:48,933
Ah, I lent my spare umbrella to Mutsuki this morning.

34
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:53,822
Haruka is with the President, so she's probably okay.

35
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:57,260
Though the President might have forgotten hers.

36
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:03,330
Well, we have some extras at the office, so it'll be fine.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,488
Um, what were we talking about again?

38
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:14,736
Ah, about you often forgetting your umbrella.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,911
But now that I think about it,

40
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,120
before meeting me,

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,832
you might have lent your umbrella to another student,

42
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,251
so that could be the reason.

43
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,777
Well, the truth doesn't really matter.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,844
By the way, do you have any plans today, Sensei?

45
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,360
No, I know you're busy, but

46
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,180
I was wondering if you had any fixed commitments after this.

47
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,760
I see.

48
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,000
No, it's just that I naturally started heading towards the Schale.

49
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,000
I was just wondering if it was okay for me to go there as well.

50
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,000
Well then, I'll join you.

51
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,940
It's fine. I've already informed the others.

52
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,000
Ah, a virtual umbrella?

53
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,020
Sorry, but I'll have to decline that.

54
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,160
If I lend you a virtual one, you'd definitely tip it to cover me more than yourself.

55
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:47,380
You know that. In fact, that's what happened last time, right?

56
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,000
There are a lot of students who would be troubled if you caught a cold.

57
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,560
So you need to take care of your health.

58
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,000
Especially since you're graciously keeping me company like this.

59
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,440
If you caught a cold after this, I'd feel really guilty.

60
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,540
Well, no, that's not quite what I meant.

61
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,540
It's not that I'd feel guilty, but rather,

62
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,400
I just don't want you to catch a cold.

63
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,600
Here, come a bit closer.

64
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,100
You'll get splashed if you stand too far.

65
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,340
It doesn't seem to be letting up at all.

66
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,000
In fact, it might be raining a little harder now.

67
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,280
Hm? The rain?

68
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,220
Oh.

69
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,000
Well, I wouldn't say I actively love it.

70
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,720
The splashing, the poor visibility, and so on.

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,680
There are girls who struggle to find shelter.

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Getting soaked or dirty from the rain itself isn't a big deal for me.

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,460
But there are people who care about me now.

74
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,460
The President and Haruka would nag me about it,

75
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,460
telling me to change clothes immediately,

76
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,494
and desperately try to wash off any stains, even though detergent is scarce.

77
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,240
As for Mutsuki, well,

78
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,260
she seems to enjoy seeing me like that more than before.

79
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,800
As I mentioned earlier, they often forget umbrellas due to their scatterbrained nature.

80
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:16,540
Just the mention of rain can escalate into a huge fuss.

81
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,320
My point wandered a bit there.

82
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,600
Anyway, I don't dislike the rain as much as I used to.

83
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, I don't dislike it.

84
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,000
That might be the closest way to express it.

85
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:45,000
And when it rains, though they get noisy, it also brings a sense of calm.

86
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,320
The sound of raindrops hitting umbrellas and the ground.

87
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,780
Being enveloped by those rhythmic yet random sounds,

88
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,260
it almost feels like the noise lessens,

89
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,654
allowing me to be still and ponder things.

90
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,860
Though with the usual noisy bunch around,

91
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,460
it's hard to have that experience.

92
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,100
Taking everything into account, I don't dislike the rain.

93
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,920
What about you, Sensei? Do you like the rain?

94
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,760
I figured you'd say that.

95
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,620
No, you don't need to give me a reason.

96
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You'll probably just say something that confuses me anyway.

97
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,380
Here, come closer.

98
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,760
I told you, you'll get splashed if you stay far away.

99
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,560
Maybe even more so.
