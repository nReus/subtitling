1
00:00:02,942 --> 00:00:05,514
It's not getting done at all.

2
00:00:16,942 --> 00:00:19,000
It's already this late.

3
00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:22,200
I'm getting sleepy.

4
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:23,971
But no.

5
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:25,914
More...

6
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:28,371
Hm?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,342
S-Sensei.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,142
W-What are you doing here?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,914
We didn't have any appointments or meetings scheduled today.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,771
Is there some business with the Prefect Team?

12
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:51,657
Y-Yeah.

13
00:00:52,714 --> 00:00:54,600
N-No, it's fine.

14
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:57,428
It's no trouble at all.

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,000
You know...

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,000
Things got a bit hectic,

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and I've been running around ever since.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I asked Ako and Iori to handle things outside.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,400
Chinatsu's been working non-stop since yesterday,

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
so I had her go home around lunchtime.

21
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:25,685
Mm...

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's really okay.

23
00:01:29,285 --> 00:01:32,828
I got the urgent stuff done for the most part.

24
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:38,542
But since the same thing could happen again,

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,542
I thought I should try to get some other work done if I can.

26
00:01:47,257 --> 00:01:49,000
*sigh*

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,114
Hm?

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
My thigh.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh yeah.

30
00:01:58,114 --> 00:02:04,000
I probably got grazed by a stray shot earlier when I was on backup.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's fine, it doesn't hurt that much.

32
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:14,000
S-Sensei.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No, I'm okay.

34
00:02:18,142 --> 00:02:21,000
You don't need to worry so much.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,257
I have a pretty sturdy body.

36
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:28,428
It'll heal quickly if I just leave it alone.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,857
Oh, well, if you say so...

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,371
It's not that big a deal if it leaves a mark.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,400
Ah.

40
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:46,142
If you're going to insist,

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,628
then I'll leave it to you.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Let's see...

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Then...

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Right.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
First aid kit.

46
00:02:58,457 --> 00:03:00,514
Yeah, it's over there.

47
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:04,000
Then, um...

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,742
Please.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,514
Ah.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,828
Ow...

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's...

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let's see...

53
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:42,971
Ow, ah, it's okay.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It just soaked through a little.

55
00:03:45,314 --> 00:03:47,771
Keep going.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,971
Sensei, I didn't know you could do that.

57
00:03:58,285 --> 00:03:59,571
Yeah.

58
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:04,628
My leg doesn't hurt anywhere in particular, but...

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,257
My ankle too, mmhmm.

60
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:17,342
If I had to say, it's just a light bruise on my thigh.

61
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,657
For this much, it's

62
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:24,885
Oh, I-I see.

63
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:28,114
Then...

64
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,857
Let's see, the tail-end was...

65
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:36,485
Oh yeah, inside that...

66
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:38,000
On the inner side.

67
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:43,914
Should I apply a little more there?

68
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:49,457
Yeah.

69
00:04:50,142 --> 00:04:52,800
Ah, thank you.

70
00:04:56,342 --> 00:04:57,857
[Because I'm] head prefect?

71
00:04:58,457 --> 00:05:00,685
It's not that

72
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:05,571
I'm tired, but it's nothing unusual.

73
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:09,000
I see.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Then...

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let me at least check my temperature.

77
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,114
Ah, w-wait a minute.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I-It's okay.

79
00:05:28,714 --> 00:05:31,257
You can put it in from here.

80
00:05:36,257 --> 00:05:41,200
Somehow it's been a while since I've had my temperature taken like this.

81
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,885

Even if I had a fever, it's not like I could take time off,

82
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:51,200
so if I did have one,

83
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:53,620
it's better not to know.

84
00:05:55,285 --> 00:05:56,914
Oh, right.

85
00:05:57,314 --> 00:05:58,600
That's true.

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,228
Now, I'm fine.

87
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:05,228
Because...

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,542
36.7 degrees.

89
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,457
Almost normal.

90
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:24,771
Yeah.

91
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:28,714
I guess I really am just a little tired.

92
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,314
Other than that, nothing in particular...

93
00:06:36,742 --> 00:06:39,457
Y-You don't have to go that far.

94
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:42,942
It's not like I'm broken down or anything.

95
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:46,371
I see.

96
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:48,285
Then...

97
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,542
Um, inside that,

98
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,342
th-that...

99
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:55,600
Could I have some of those?

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,257
Yeah, the cooling pads.

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I was thinking of putting them over my eyes.

102
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:06,657
It's okay.

103
00:07:07,457 --> 00:07:08,828
Probably...

104
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:11,371
I'm just sleepy.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,714
I don't think there's any swelling.

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,628
Is there a mirror somewhere?

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Sensei, you...

108
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:28,800
Y-Yeah.

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay.

110
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:39,542
Done?

111
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah.

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,428
You're right, Chinatsu said the same thing I think.

113
00:07:51,114 --> 00:07:52,514
In that case,

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,285
it's better not to cool it down.

115
00:07:56,428 --> 00:07:57,428
Hot water?

116
00:07:57,885 --> 00:08:00,400
Then, that faucet over there.

117
00:08:01,457 --> 00:08:03,114
Ah, I'll do it.

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Y-Yeah.

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay, please.

120
00:08:16,257 --> 00:08:18,028
Thank you

121
00:08:19,314 --> 00:08:21,200
for the towel.

122
00:08:21,828 --> 00:08:23,600
It's warm.

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Should I just place this over my eyes?

124
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:32,714
Yeah.

125
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:34,485
Okay.

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This really...

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
feels so nice.

128
00:08:56,457 --> 00:08:57,971
Somehow...

129
00:08:58,342 --> 00:09:00,142
today in particular,

130
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:03,057
I've done nothing but cause you trouble, Sensei.

131
00:09:05,514 --> 00:09:08,771
It helps to hear you say that.

132
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:11,828
Hm?

133
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:14,200
That's...

134
00:09:14,314 --> 00:09:15,828
um...

135
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:17,885
Lying down,

136
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:20,600
I feel like I might fall asleep like this.

137
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:26,771
I did get the necessary stuff done today, but...

138
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:31,228
Yeah.

139
00:09:33,342 --> 00:09:34,685
This...

140
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:38,057
feels really nice, but...

141
00:09:38,742 --> 00:09:40,600
I'm seriously

142
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:43,200
about to fall asleep.

143
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:06,600
It's warm.

144
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:26,571
Sensei.

145
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:29,057
So...

146
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,371
After a little while,

147
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:34,514
I'll wake up.

148
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,800
Until then...

149
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:44,885
Could you stay by my side...

150
00:10:47,485 --> 00:10:49,600
until I open my eyes?

151
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,600
Thank you.

152
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:58,000
You really are...

153
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:00,200
so kind.

154
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Hm?

155
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Y-You've already

156
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,885
done more than enough

157
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:15,971
for me in so many ways

158
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:25,914
No one else has come yet, right?

159
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:31,857
Um...

160
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:33,914
before that,

161
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:36,971
when we get to Schale,

162
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,542
could you...

163
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,050
Thank you, Sensei.

164
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
*sigh*

165
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,942
Just a little longer

166
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:03,000
like this.

167
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,010
