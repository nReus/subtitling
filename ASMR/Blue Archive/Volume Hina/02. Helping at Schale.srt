1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,680
Sensei, good work today.

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,466
Oh, I just got here, don't mind me.

3
00:00:16,626 --> 00:00:22,413
Rather, I hope I won't get in the way of your work.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm the only one on duty today?

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
No, it's not that I mind or anything.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Anyway, where should I start helping today?

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
As usual, there's a huge pile of paperwork.

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, the Prefect Team has a lot too, but we also have Ako and Chinatsu to help out.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,330
Come to think of it, Sensei not only has us,

10
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:19,000
but fairies from all kinds of clubs and schools come here.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Alright, I'll start looking over here.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,720
This one and this are done, it seems.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's okay, I can figure most of it out.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If there's anything I'm unsure about, I'll ask you then.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
After all, it would defeat the purpose if I troubled Sensei.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:06,000
For paperwork to submit to the Student Council Federation, the Prefect Team uses similar formats, so I know what to do.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'll borrow some stationery around here.

18
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This one and this, I'll go through everything first.

20
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:08,200
This goes here, and here, like so.

21
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,866
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And this one goes...

23
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,533
I think it was like this.

24
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,200
Hmm, wait a minute.

25
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,200
Hm?

26
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:57,000
I-It's okay, it's not heavy at all. I'm not in danger.

27
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Not in danger. Yeah, leave it to me.

28
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's probably the format.

29
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Name, address.

30
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,733
Hmm...

31
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:51,200
What else...

32
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,933
Sensei, I'll borrow this area.

33
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:59,666
It's the same as the invalid forms, right?

34
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:03,733
Yeah, I'll clean them up together.

35
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:10,800
This and...

36
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:19,644
Yeah.

37
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:23,066
Hmm...

38
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:28,800
Uh, let's see...

39
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:38,488
Hmm...

40
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,000
There's a misalignment here.

41
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh.

42
00:05:55,377 --> 00:05:57,000
Right.

43
00:05:58,577 --> 00:06:00,177
Okay.

44
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:05,155
Yeah.

45
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:06,533
Yeah.

46
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:13,333
Let's see...

47
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah.

48
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,400
Just to be sure, one more time.

49
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:35,022
Yeah.

50
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:37,200
Yeah.

51
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:39,288
Yeah.

52
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:56,000
Good work, Sensei. Did we make some progress?

53
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yes.

54
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Sensei, you look tired.

55
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,577
I'll make some coffee for you.

56
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:09,511
May I use the kitchen?

57
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:17,000
It's okay. I know where it is, you sit tight.

58
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's see...

59
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,800
I think it was...

60
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Hmm...

61
00:07:38,222 --> 00:07:40,930
Uh, let's see...

62
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:51,600
The varieties keep increasing.

63
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:12,000
Wait a minute.

64
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Just a minute.

65
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
A little more.

66
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah.

67
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah.

68
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,644
Yes, alright.

69
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Sorry for the wait, Sensei.

70
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,022
I made some coffee, but...

71
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:59,155
Have a sip.

72
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:03,333
Y-You don't have to be so eager about it.

73
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's hot out, so take your time.

74
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Is it... good?

75
00:09:13,822 --> 00:09:16,488
I see, I'm glad.

76
00:09:18,888 --> 00:09:22,444
I don't usually make it myself,

77
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:25,422
so I was a little worried.

78
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,177
Ako normally makes it for me.

79
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,955
You didn't have to gulp it down like that.

80
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,244
I-I can't take your cup either.

81
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,000
You have to drink it.

82
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
There's no point otherwise.

83
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Honestly.

84
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:47,000
The paperwork?

85
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Ah, everything that was on that desk over there is done.

86
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,514
But there are some parts that need you to look over, Sensei.

87
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,257
I have time now.

88
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay, first...

89
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The stamp is missing here.

90
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And the back side is also required here, so be careful.

91
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This part and this part.

92
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:16,742
Right.

93
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:19,828
Here and here.

94
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,685
Also this border section.

95
00:10:25,828 --> 00:10:30,085
I think you should look over this stack, Sensei.

96
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:33,800
There's some tricky stuff written inside.

97
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:36,342
Yeah, that's right.

98
00:10:37,742 --> 00:10:42,342
It's together with that paperwork, so if you look it over, you'll understand.

99
00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:48,657
The records for that time are in this folder.

100
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:53,942
With these two, you should be able to make a judgment.

101
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,514
The rest I'll leave to you.

102
00:10:57,571 --> 00:11:02,771
Also, the numbers in this paperwork need to be fixed.

103
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,342
The Student Council will probably just send it back if we don't.

104
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,457
Let's see, the Arabic numerals too, and here,

105
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:16,000
the calculations are wrong.

106
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:21,342
It's probably because of the mismatch here and the increase here.

107
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:25,371
This shift and the growth here are causing it.

108
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I see.

109
00:11:28,742 --> 00:11:33,714
I redid the calculations for the rest, but it was just this part so it's fine.

110
00:11:34,657 --> 00:11:37,914
I don't think I should input it myself without permission,

111
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,885
so I just recompiled the files and the accurate figures.

112
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,942
If you enter this as is, it should be okay,

113
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,542
but you may want to recalculate it yourself, Sensei.

114
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,685
I sorted the rest into categories.

115
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,885
These just need looking over,

116
00:12:00,142 --> 00:12:02,571
and these require entries.

117
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,628
I've filled in the simple parts here.

118
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:11,457
I've only entered sections I can fill out as your proxy,

119
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:12,714
so please be careful.

120
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,171
I've left notes for parts that need your input.

121
00:12:17,342 --> 00:12:20,342
They're ordered by upcoming deadlines, but

122
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,142
there may be some with importance I can't grasp,

123
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:29,314
so I think you should look over these by the end of this week.

124
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:32,857
This is the only deadline this week.

125
00:12:34,742 --> 00:12:37,600
That's about everything, I think.

126
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,257
I didn't see anything in particular I didn't understand after going through it all.

127
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:48,228
Let me know if anything seems off.

128
00:12:51,714 --> 00:12:56,571
I-It's not like this is a big deal or anything.

129
00:12:57,314 --> 00:13:00,714
It feels nice to be told that, but...

130
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:04,828
Um,

131
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
is there anything else I can help with?

132
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:13,914
Oh, I see.

133
00:13:14,657 --> 00:13:18,400
So that stuff you were working on earlier...

134
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:23,457
You finished it without me noticing, huh?

135
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,457
That's good then.

136
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,428
What's wrong?

137
00:13:32,571 --> 00:13:35,314
Y-You want praise?

138
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I mean,

139
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
um,

140
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
what should I do?

141
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Huh?

142
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh,

143
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
never mind,

144
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
if that's good enough for Sensei.

145
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Then...

146
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,714
Excuse me for a moment.

147
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
G-Good job...

148
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,514
I-Is this good enough?

149
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I see.

150
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,310
But, certainly,

151
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,650
I know you've been working hard, Sensei.

152
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Good work.

153
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Somehow,

154
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,571
patting your head

155
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,371
feels a little embarrassing.

156
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,857
M-Me too?

157
00:14:38,228 --> 00:14:40,370
Uh, um,

158
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I-

159
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's okay.

160
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
For now,

161
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm fine with it.
