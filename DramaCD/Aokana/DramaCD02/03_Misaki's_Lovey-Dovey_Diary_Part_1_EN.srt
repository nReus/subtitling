Misaki's Lovey-Dovey Diary - Part 1

3
00:00:14,499 --> 00:00:18,136
Okay, the fluorescent light's cord is first buoy,

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,140
this spot on the bookshelf is second buoy,

5
00:00:21,774 --> 00:00:25,211
the closet handle is third buoy, and the stain on the wall is fourth buoy.

6
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:28,947
And with that, a field has been born in my room!

7
00:00:30,515 --> 00:00:37,021
So, this Shito-kun I'm holding in my right hand is me, and the Shito-kun in my left hand is him.

8
00:00:37,588 --> 00:00:40,725
With that setup, let the practice match begin!

9
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,465
To develop my FC head, daily training is necessary, you know!

10
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:52,637
Practicing hard in my room even after regular practice... that's our admirable Misaki-chan!

11
00:00:53,271 --> 00:01:00,311
By repeatedly playing matches on this indoor field, I'll aim to become the world's greatest brainy Sky Walker!

12
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:04,582
I won't let anyone say I just fly by intuition anymore!

13
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,317
Let's do this! Yeah!

14
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:08,452
Go for it, me!

15
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:13,924
Well, it's a bit late to bring this up now, but...

16
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,328
Shito-kun really has a weird face...

17
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:24,201
No wonder so many islanders said they found it physiologically unacceptable. I get it.

18
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,474
Substituting ourselves with these...

19
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:33,110
Yeah, I have some reservations about it.

20
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:35,212
Hmm.

21
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:39,216
But hey, if I get used to it, even Shito-kun will start looking cute!

22
00:01:40,284 --> 00:01:43,287
It takes quite... well...

23
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:50,127
Umm, depending on my effort, depending on how hard I try, I can just barely manage to see it as cute!

24
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:58,068
Besides, this is a precious stuffed toy he won for me in a crane game at the arcade.

25
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:00,170
Hrmmm...

26
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:02,940
Focus, focus.

27
00:02:03,574 --> 00:02:06,410
It looks cute, it looks cute, it looks cute, it looks cute...

28
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:08,812
Mmm, yaah!

29
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:10,247
I see it! I can see it!

30
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:12,983
It looked cute! Shito-kun is cute!

31
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:19,089
Right then, I'll put my soul into the right-hand Shito-kun.

32
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,260
Alright, it's in!

33
00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:28,065
And then, I'll arbitrarily put his soul into the left-hand Shito-kun.

34
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:33,303
It's in!

35
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:34,771
There we go.

36
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:37,908
Okay, now we can start the practice match!

37
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:41,645
Alright, let's have a match today too!

38
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:45,615
First, wait at the fluorescent light cord's first buoy.

39
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:48,652
Hello, Misaki.

40
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:50,954
Let's have a good match today.

41
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:54,658
Likewise! Let's do our best, Darling.

42
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:58,028
Alright then, before the match starts...

43
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:03,733
Wh-What are you doing all of a sudden?

44
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:10,740
There's no rule saying you can't kiss before a match, right?

45
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:17,380
W-Well, maybe there isn't a rule like that, but it's bad manners! That!

46
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:18,948
My bad.

47
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:21,651
Well then, shall we start the match?

48
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:25,989
What are you doing?

49
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:27,457
Counter-attack!

50
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:32,462
If someone suddenly kisses you, isn't it good manners to return the sudden kiss?

51
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:37,433
Which means, I have to kiss you next.

52
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:41,671
But if we do that, the kissing will never end.

53
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:46,342
That's exactly what I want! The first one to stop loses, you know!

54
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:53,516
Hey, am I an idiot?!

55
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:56,919
What on earth am I doing, squishing stuffed animals together?!

56
00:03:57,954 --> 00:03:58,588
Ah!

57
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:03,226
I slammed the Shito-kun with my and his souls against the wall!

58
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,828
I did such a terrible thing...

59
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:08,865
Haaah.

60
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:14,670
I know I need to take this seriously, but...

61
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:17,540
Oof.

62
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:24,180
Even while thinking that, I end up lying down on the bed. That's me.

63
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:26,082
Haaah.

64
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:28,918
Somehow, I'm just not in the mood.

65
00:04:29,952 --> 00:04:33,623
Today's practice was pretty hard, so maybe I'm just tired.

66
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:36,192
Haaah.

67
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:38,828
Haaah.

68
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,763
Haaaaah.

69
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:43,332
Aaaah.

70
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:47,370
Aaaah... aaaah...

71
00:04:49,338 --> 00:04:51,841
I'll do my best-zoi.

72
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,011
Hm.

73
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:58,814
Haaah.

74
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,653
He looked cool during practice today, too.

75
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,223
I wonder what he's doing right now.

76
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:10,059
Mmm.

77
00:05:10,926 --> 00:05:13,562
Is he thinking about me, even a little?

78
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:17,967
I'm his girlfriend, so of course he is, right?

79
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:21,136
Or is he thinking about some other girl?

80
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:28,010
No, he's a coach, so even if he *is* thinking about another girl...

81
00:05:28,577 --> 00:05:30,346
Well, that's to be expected, but...

82
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:37,453
The Shito-kun imbued with his soul is... over there, huh.

83
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:41,190
Hello? This is Misaki.

84
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,126
Can you hear me through Shito-kun?

85
00:05:44,693 --> 00:05:45,761
Please respond.

86
00:05:46,895 --> 00:05:48,364
Hellooo?

87
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:50,232
Wait,

88
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:56,438
if it actually responded and Shito-kun started talking, like some occult phenomenon...

89
00:05:56,805 --> 00:06:00,242
I'd immediately throw Shito-kun out the window, but...

90
00:06:01,877 --> 00:06:07,016
Putting that aside, I'm just thinking I'd like to hear his voice.

91
00:06:08,484 --> 00:06:11,720
I could probably tolerate a small occult phenomenon.

92
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:21,864
Maybe I'll try giving it a big squee~eze hug like this.

93
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:27,469
Doing something really girly like this...

94
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:32,674
Getting weirdly flustered...

95
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:41,083
It'd be pretty scary if I heard a voice, but just feeling his warmth might be kind of girly-cute, maybe.

96
00:06:43,552 --> 00:06:44,953
No, that's still scary.

97
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:48,357
A lukewarm Shito-kun is pure horror.

98
00:06:48,924 --> 00:06:50,826
A purification ritual at a temple would be mandatory.

99
00:06:52,227 --> 00:06:52,961
Aah.

100
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:07,265
Mmmm.

101
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:10,270
Haaah.

102
00:07:14,374 --> 00:07:18,678
I don't mind if it's an occult phenomenon, I just want to hear his voice, and...

103
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:23,216
just for a little bit, I want to feel some warmth.

104
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:26,853
Hello? Please answer me.

105
00:07:27,354 --> 00:07:31,558
I'm thinking of you so desperately, you know?

106
00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:37,897
If only these feelings could ride on some suspicious radio waves and reach him...

107
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:41,067
Isn't there a machine for that?

108
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:43,603
Haaah.

109
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:49,676
It would be nice if there was a convenient machine to deliver my voice to him.

110
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:51,444
Huh?

111
00:07:52,378 --> 00:07:52,812
Ah.

112
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,480
Huh?

113
00:07:54,214 --> 00:07:54,814
There is!

114
00:07:55,148 --> 00:07:56,416
It was right in front of me!

115
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:57,984
You mean a phone!

116
00:07:58,618 --> 00:07:59,919
Civilization is amazing!

117
00:08:00,553 --> 00:08:02,755
Um, who invented the telephone again?

118
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:04,457
Umm, Bell?

119
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:05,892
Yeah, pretty sure it was Bell.

120
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:09,796
You're brilliant, Bell! Woo! *clap clap clap*

121
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:16,836
Lying around like this, thinking dangerously girly thoughts, isn't like me.

122
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,272
My style is being a fighter!

123
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:21,908
I attack! I attack with my cell phone!

124
00:08:23,476 --> 00:08:23,876
Ah.

125
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,780
But warmth doesn't travel through a cell phone, huh.

126
00:08:29,515 --> 00:08:32,185
Hmm, civilization isn't that amazing after all.

127
00:08:32,752 --> 00:08:33,853
It needs to do better.

128
00:08:34,187 --> 00:08:36,155
I think it could if it tried.

129
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,292
Why doesn't it take things seriously?

130
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:40,960
Mmm.

131
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:44,997
Just hearing his voice feels kinda boring.

132
00:08:45,865 --> 00:08:47,233
I want more, like...

133
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,069
hugging tightly, or being hugged tightly...

134
00:08:50,636 --> 00:08:52,071
That's what I want.

135
00:08:32,848 --> 00:08:54,140
Mmmm.

136
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:55,808
Ah, geez!

137
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:58,578
What should I do about this frustration?

138
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:04,317
His girlfriend is feeling gloomy, so I wish he'd use psychic powers to sense it and rush over.

139
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:07,453
I think it's okay for a boyfriend to do that much.

140
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:10,056
Is there some way... huh?

141
00:09:10,857 --> 00:09:12,959
I didn't need to worry about that!

142
00:09:13,426 --> 00:09:15,194
I didn't need psychic powers either!

143
00:09:16,062 --> 00:09:17,864
Um, first, I make a call,

144
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:18,965
Yep.

145
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,136
Answer... answer... He answered!

146
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:30,643
Hello? Your cute girlfriend is coming over to see you right now, so make sure you're fully prepared for hugs and waiting!

147
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:32,011
Hmph!

148
00:09:32,845 --> 00:09:34,113
There, that's settled.

149
00:09:34,747 --> 00:09:37,016
Alright Shito-kun, hold down the fort, okay?

150
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,486
I'll practice properly when I get back, so wait for me!

151
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:44,023
Yahooey!
