1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate, Drama CD

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,370
Watch out, Hazuki-sensei!

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,370
[PAUSE]

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,450
Yoo-hoo! Yuu-kun!

5
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,200
Pardon the intrusion~!

6
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,600
It's Shinonome Hazuki!

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,840
Ahahaha!

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,330
Hmm? I just happened to be in the neighborhood,

9
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,970
So I thought I'd drop by to see my beloved Yuu-kun's face!

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,700
Oh, was that not okay?

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,400
Well, you know...

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,300
Between you and me, Yuu-kun,

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,100
There's nothing off-limits anymore, right?

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh my, oh my?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,360
Oh my, my, my, my, my!

17
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,150
sniff sniff sniff sniff

18
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,930
What's that delicious smell?

19
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,110
Could it be...

20
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,930
I think I know what it is!

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,360
Oh, my feet are moving on their own, taking me into Yuu-kun's house!

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,820
Oh, my feet, they're moving by themselves!

23
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,260
Ahahahaha!

24
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,750
Wobble, wobble, wobble...

25
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,040
Oops...

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,350
But first, I should take off my shoes.

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,920
Huh? Ehehe...

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,210
My hands are moving on their own too, somehow.

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,790
But my feet are also moving on their own to take off my shoes.

30
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,790
Hahahahaha!

31
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,770
That was close.

32
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,420
Thank you, Yuu-kun.

33
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,570
I almost bumped my forehead against the wall.

34
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,350
You're always so reliable, aren't you?

35
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,910
I'm fine, really.

36
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,710
I've had a bit to drink, but I'm not that drunk.

37
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,790
I'm just a little tipsy, that's all.

38
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,120
I'm telling you, I'm okay!

39
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,440
My liver is eleven times stronger than normal.

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,820
I could keep drinking way more!

41
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,070
Hahahaha!

42
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,440
Well then,

43
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,370
I guess I'll be making my way in now.

44
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,150
Huh?

45
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,120
You're saying it's not good...

46
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,160
For a teacher to visit a student's house privately?

47
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,430
It's fine, it's fine! Love conquers all, right?

48
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,050
Yuu-kun's house...

49
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,390
Uhuhu, it smells just like Yuu-kun!

50
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,570
Oh my, oh my! There's such delicious-looking food on the table!

51
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,360
Mmm~

52
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:15,280
Not only does it smell good, but the colors are balanced too - red, yellow, green...

53
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,210
It looks so nutritious, just like Yuu-kun's cooking should be.

54
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,330
Hey, hey, Yuu-kun, isn't there any for me?

55
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,750
Let me have some of Yuu-kun's cooking too!

56
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:36,030
I want to eat Yuu-kun's food... Hey, hey, come on!

57
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,790
Aww, I can't?

58
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,270
Yuu-kun's cooking...

59
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,990
You won't let me eat any of it?

60
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,850
Yuu-kun, you're so kind!

61
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,510
I love you so much!

62
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,230
Ahaha,

63
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,890
Too bad, you're right. I was fake crying.

64
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:12,610
But, but, I love how Yuu-kun responds so seriously to my silly little lies.

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,550
Ahaha!

66
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,760
Well then,

67
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,320
I'll just sit myself down right here~

68
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:26,440
Come on, Yuu-kun, sit down too! Hurry, hurry!

69
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,730
Yuu-kun, here. Aah~

70
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,610
What's the matter?

71
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,230
There's nothing wrong with a woman being a little spoiled, is there?

72
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,610
So come on,

73
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,610
Aah~

74
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,610
Delicious!

75
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,610
Yuu-kun's fried shrimp!

76
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,610
The breading is so crispy, and the shrimp is so juicy.

77
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,250
It's a perfect harmony in my mouth!

78
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,470
Mmm~ This fried rice is great too.

79
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,070
The rice is perfectly separated,

80
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:18,880
And the amount of egg is just right. I can't even describe it!

81
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,640
Marvelous!

82
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,600
Yuu-kun's cooking is really the best.

83
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,010
Oh? Oh my, oh my!

84
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,230
I just realized something terrible!

85
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,710
What should I do, what should I do, what should I do?

86
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,950
What, you ask?

87
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,930
Fufu~

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,030
What do you think it is, Yuu-kun?

89
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,260
I see, you can't imagine what it could be.

90
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
It's about your mother, Yuu-kun.

91
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,240
I wonder if she's home right now.

92
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,150
I see.

93
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,820
That was close.

94
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,340
She's not coming home today, huh?

95
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,460
Wait...

96
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,520
Eh?

97
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,780
She's not coming home?

98
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,780
Well, well, did you hear that, ladies and gentlemen?!

99
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,780
Yuu-kun's mother isn't coming home today!

100
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:22,050
My, my, I've certainly come at the perfect time, haven't I?

101
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,780
Yuu-kun, you were expecting this, weren't you?

102
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,780
Don't try to lie, it won't work.

103
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:36,290
Hazuki-sensei can see right through you, you know.

104
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,630
Why? Well, because I'm your beloved girlfriend, of course.

105
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,630
Let me ask you this, what do you think, Yuu-kun?

106
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,510
Do you think I'm not expecting anything?

107
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,280
Do I look like I'm not expecting anything?

108
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,430
That's right~ Fufu.

109
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,110
I'm just being honest,

110
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,150
And I certainly can't lie to you, Yuu-kun.

111
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,190
I'm in such a happy mood.

112
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,240
Besides, alcohol goes so well with Yuu-kun's cooking,

113
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,090
I think I'll have some more!

114
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,920
Phew!

115
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,930
Wow! I feel alive again!

116
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,030
Why is alcohol so delicious, I wonder?

117
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:36,510
I feel like I'm floating on a cloud, drifting about.

118
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:41,670
It feels like I could fly anywhere, it's so wonderful.

119
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,600
How about it? Want to drink too, Yuu-kun?

120
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,370
You'll pass?

121
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,000
Haha!

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,160
Could it be that innocent Yuu-kun is worried about an indirect kiss?

123
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,690
Oh, come on, at this point?

124
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,080
Between you and me...

125
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,470
Is it a no-go because you're a student?

126
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,040
Oh, please.

127
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,640
Don't be so uptight.

128
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,660
You silly~

129
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,810
Tickle tickle tickle

130
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,080
Just because you can't drink my alcohol...

131
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,230
You, you, you, you, you, you

132
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,580
You, you, you, you, you

133
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,040
Oops-

134
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,830
Ah, ah, ah!

135
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,930
Oh no!

136
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,110
It's cold-

137
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,930
Ah, aah!

138
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:32,400
I'm sorry! Ow, ow, ow...

139
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,650
Thank you, Yuu-kun.

140
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,170
For protecting me...

141
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:36,760
Ah... ah...
For protecting me...

142
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,170
Ah... ah...

143
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,270
Yuu-kun's lips...

144
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,670
They're so close I can feel your breath...

145
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,170
Ah...

146
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,360
Oh, no, it's just... your breath tickles, Yuu-kun.

147
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,990
Suddenly getting all serious like that...

148
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,830
Don't ask me things like that every single time, geez.

149
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,490
Yuu-kun...

150
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,710
Hehe...

151
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,570
That was such a tender kiss.

152
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,590
Even so, for just a moment, my mind went completely blank.

153
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,510
But you know, Yuu-kun...

154
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,600
Don't you think your kissing is getting better and better?

155
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:42,790
You haven't been kissing anyone else besides me, have you?

156
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:49,770
Ahaha, you're saying such sweet things.

157
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,270
"There's only Hazuki-sensei for me," huh?

158
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,250
You sure know how to sweet-talk a woman.

159
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,570
That's right...

160
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,960
Yuu-kun only ever tells the truth, doesn't he?

161
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,450
I know that very well.

162
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,000
But look, we've spilled some alcohol.

163
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,330
Ah, it's all sticky... This feels gross.

164
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,650
Oh, Yuu-kun, you're all sticky too.

165
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:26,170
Hehe, what a mess we've made of ourselves.

166
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,890
We can't leave our clothes like this. What should we do?

167
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,880
What to do...

168
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,210
Oh, I just had a great idea!

169
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:49,430
Let's take a bath together and clean off all this stickiness, Yuu-kun!

170
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,910
Now that that's decided, come on, strip, strip!

171
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,970
Gehehe, isn't this great? Isn't it wonderful?

172
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,920
I wonder if it's okay... You'd better join me...

173
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,960
Or I might just go searching for naughty books or DVDs in your room.

174
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,310
Got you!

175
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,250
Now, let's head to the bath together! Let's go!
