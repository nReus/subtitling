1
00:00:09,493 --> 00:00:10,361
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,400
I was so focused on the sweets that I only picked intense attractions...

3
00:00:21,372 --> 00:00:25,809
And because of that, you ended up feeling unwell...

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,460
So...

5
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,390
I'm truly sorry.

6
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,680
Ah!

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,840
Don't move.

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,500
You should rest a little longer.

9
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:46,497
Don't push yourself.

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,130
Oh, I know.

11
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,440
Shall I go get you a cold drink or something?

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,840
Is just having me nearby enough?

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,840
Is there anything else you'd like me to do?

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,220
A lap pillow?

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,540
You want me to give you a lap pillow?

16
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,320
Of course, that's fine. If my lap is okay, please, go ahead.

17
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,680
Nh.

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,400
How are you feeling?

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,260
I see.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,940
That's good.

21
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,760
So, what should we do after this?

22
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,240
Somewhere you want to go?

23
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,920
Let me see...

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,200
If it's okay with you, I'd like to try riding the Ferris wheel.

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,260
Is that okay?

26
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,560
Okay.

27
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,828
Thank you.

28
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,080
Well then, after you rest a bit more, let's ride the Ferris wheel.

29
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,500
The view is beautiful!

30
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,067
Look, you can see the whole park!

31
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,560
The view from the sky feels so nice, doesn't it?

32
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,180
Don't you think so too?

33
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,700
I'm more beautiful than the view?

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,960
Since when did you become such a smooth talker?

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,320
But, if you're feeling like that, it seems your condition isn't a problem anymore.

36
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,120
That's good.

37
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,860
Alright then, let's have the limited-edition sweet, the baked apple cream puff.

38
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,080
The nice thing about the Ferris wheel is that you can enjoy sweets while riding the attraction.

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,800
Well then...

40
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,245
Mmm...

41
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:35,060
The pastry is crisp and fragrant, and the tartness of the apple perfectly matches the sweetness of the cream...

42
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,920
Ah?

43
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,940
Why the sudden strange face? What's wrong?

44
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,440
Behind me?

45
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,860
What's behind me?

46
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,160
Huh? A bug?!

47
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,180
It came this way?! Aah!

48
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,780
I'm sorry, suddenly shouting like that...

49
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,960
It just happened so suddenly, I was startled.

50
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,467
My heart is still pounding.

51
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,260
Huh?

52
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,700
You can feel my heartbeat directly?

53
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,140
Ah!

54
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,140
Um...

55
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,640
Well...

56
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,460
Sorry for the commotion.

57
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,500
I'm sorry for suddenly clinging to you like that.

58
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,620
I must have bothered you.

59
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,780
A perk?

60
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,540
Well then, maybe I should cling to you one more time?

61
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,940
Hehe.

62
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,600
Just kidding.

63
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,460
Okay then, let's eat the rest of the cream puff...

64
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,260
Oh?

65
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,260
During that commotion, some cream got on you.

66
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,160
Mm-hmm, it's on the other side.

67
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,420
No, not there...

68
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,780
Hold still for a moment, would you?

69
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,360
It's alright, just hold still, okay? Got it?

70
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,840
*lick*

71
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,260
There. It's off.

72
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,960
Since it was just the two of us, I licked it off without thinking, but...

73
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,720
Was that a little ill-mannered?

74
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,360
Hehe.
