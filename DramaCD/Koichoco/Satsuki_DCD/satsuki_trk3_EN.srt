1
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:21,969
Which attraction should we go to first?

2
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:28,576
Big Parfait Mountain...

3
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,945
Marshmallow Tours...

4
00:00:31,846 --> 00:00:33,314
Milky World...

5
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:37,718
There are so many, it's hard to decide, isn't it?

6
00:00:41,022 --> 00:00:42,456
Hmm, let's see...

7
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:46,961
How about this Chocolate Splash?

8
00:00:48,062 --> 00:00:54,769
You ride a boat down the river and experience the story of the little people who make chocolate.

9
00:00:57,638 --> 00:00:59,440
That sounds quite interesting, doesn't it?

10
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:04,812
I wonder if it ends with falling down a waterfall?

11
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:08,416
Hey, what do you think?

12
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:10,518
Oh?

13
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:18,626
That look on your face... maybe you're not good with this kind of thing?

14
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:22,930
Are you really okay?

15
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:29,070
I see. In that case, Chocolate Splash should be fine, right?

16
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,171
Let's go.

17
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:53,909
Phew.

18
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:59,782
The end was surprising, but it was quite fun.

19
00:02:02,484 --> 00:02:02,785
Ah.

20
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,524
It looks like the photos from the moment we dropped are displayed on that monitor over there.

21
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:12,361
I wonder how we look in them.

22
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:14,196
Let's go see.

23
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:25,374
Um...

24
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,877
Our photo is...

25
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:33,082
Found it! That's the one.

26
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:38,587
You're making quite a face!

27
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:43,592
So you really didn't like it, huh?

28
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:46,495
Huh?

29
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:50,432
I clung onto you?

30
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:55,704
Why would you say such nonsense?

31
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,760
Certainly, in the monitor, it looks like I'm clinging to you, but that's wrong.

32
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,760
You were the one clinging.

33
00:03:11,486 --> 00:03:13,488
Do you have any objections?

34
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,240
Well, if there's nothing else, let's end this discussion and go eat the limited-edition sweets.

35
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:31,810
Um, it looks like we pick up the sweets at that counter over there and eat them at the tables further back.

36
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,480
Alright then, let's go buy them right away!

37
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,900
So these truffle chocolates are the limited-edition sweets you can buy at Chocolate Splash.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,600
Wow! They're beautiful, like candy sculptures.

39
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:05,410
And they smell so good... Mmm... They look incredibly delicious.

40
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,060
Well then, time to try them.

41
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,100
Ooh.

42
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,740
Mmm.

43
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,260
Delicious!

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,700
Wonderful! Excellent! This chocolate is a perfect 100 out of 100!

45
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:38,980
The chocolate melts smoothly on my tongue, and the deep flavor of cacao gently spreads through my mouth...

46
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:46,520
I can't take it anymore... It's so delicious, I feel like I'm going to melt too...

47
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:49,584
Haaa...

48
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,920
I want to bask in this sweet afterglow forever...

49
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,080
Ah.

50
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,080
Ex-Excuse me.

51
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,360
I got carried away again, didn't I?

52
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,260
It was just so delicious that I couldn't help it...

53
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,760
Please, don't say anything.

54
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,520
If you say something now, I'll get really embarrassed.

55
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,700
Even so, Sweets Island is a wonderful place, isn't it?

56
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:43,040
Not only are the attractions fun, but to think we can eat such delicious sweets!

57
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,260
Nom.

58
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,720
Ahh.

59
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,880
I'm so happy, I feel like I could lose my mind.

60
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,620
I'm really glad we came to Sweets Island.

61
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,080
What is it? Staring at my face like that.

62
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,720
Is there something on it?

63
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,220
Huh?

64
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,180
The reason I hadn't been to Sweets Island until now?

65
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,680
Well, it's partly that I didn't have the chance, but...

66
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:32,500
I had decided that my first time at Sweets Island would be with someone I like.

67
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,920
That's the reason.

68
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,200
Hehe.

69
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,540
Well then, let's head to the next attraction soon.

70
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,960
Next, is Big Parfait Mountain okay?

71
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,500
It's decided then.

72
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,360
Alright then, let's go quickly! We've got no time to waste!
