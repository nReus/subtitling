1
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,820
Today was fun, wasn't it?

2
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,360
Riding various attractions, enjoying delicious sweets...

3
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,540
Oh, right, we bought lots of souvenirs too.

4
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:38,305
Raisin butter, bitter chocolate, caramel popcorn...

5
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,180
I bought them thinking they'd be snacks to go with drinks, but I wonder if my sister will like them.

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:57,300
True, it's all sweets, but my sister snacks on sweets while drinking, so that part should be fine. No need to worry.

7
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:08,569
Right. Like you said, she'll probably complain that the essential drinks are missing.

8
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,460
But they didn't sell alcohol, so she'll have to make do with these.

9
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,957
Even so, today was truly a wonderful day.

10
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,960
It's been a long time since I had such a fun day.

11
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:30,680
Let's come back to Sweets Island together again sometime.

12
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:40,120
Yes, it's a promise. Oh, right, let's do a pinky swear.

13
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:46,907
No? You can't keep the promise?

14
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,740
In that case, let's do a pinky swear.

15
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,540
Okay then.

16
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:09,629
Pinky swear, made a promise. If you tell a lie, swallow a thousand needles. Pinky promise sealed.

17
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,060
Now, if you break this promise, I won't forgive you.

18
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,860
Well then, my house is that way, so let's part ways here.

19
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,320
See you tomorrow.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,120
Goodbye.

21
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,180
What's wrong?

22
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,600
You seem fidgety. Is there something you want to say?

23
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,880
It's nothing?

24
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,400
But you've been glancing at my face since a moment ago.

25
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,480
Is there something on my lips?

26
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,320
Just blushing doesn't tell me anything.

27
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,800
If you have something to say, please say it clearly.

28
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:18,780
Since you're silent, I'll interpret that as there being nothing in particular. Is that okay with you?

29
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,400
I see. In that case, I'll be heading home.

30
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,680
Oh, right, right.

31
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,320
Speaking of which, I forgot I had a souvenir for you.

32
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,760
I made sure to get one for you too.

33
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:48,660
I'll give it to you now, but I want to surprise you, so could you close your eyes?

34
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,260
Yes, just like that. Stay still.

35
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,500
This is your souvenir.

36
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,620
Well then, good night.
