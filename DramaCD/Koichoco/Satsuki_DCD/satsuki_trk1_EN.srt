00:00:39,197 --> 00:00:39,998
Good morning!

2
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:42,200
It's hot again today, isn't it?

3
00:00:44,202 --> 00:00:44,602
Yes,

4
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,471
I've waited a little while.

5
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:48,206
Let's see...

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,541
About 30 minutes, I think?

7
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:57,215
You kept the promised time, so there's no need to apologize.

8
00:00:58,116 --> 00:01:03,254
I was just so looking forward to our date that I ended up arriving earlier than scheduled.

9
00:01:04,422 --> 00:01:09,160
Besides, it's not like I was bored while waiting.

10
00:01:11,162 --> 00:01:11,596
Yes.

11
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:20,205
Just thinking about you while I waited made my heart pound and filled me with excitement.

12
00:01:22,273 --> 00:01:22,774
Oh?

13
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,178
Your face is red. Is something wrong?

14
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:31,483
Could it be that you're embarrassed?

15
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:36,921
Oh? Well, if it's nothing, then it's fine.

16
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:45,563
By the way, you look like you want to say something. What is it?

17
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:51,136
Is something wrong with this outfit?

18
00:01:52,337 --> 00:01:59,377
I bought it just for today, but... maybe it's too childish?

19
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:05,984
C-Cute? You think it's cute?

20
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:12,624
Hearing you say that makes me a little embarrassed.

21
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:17,662
But I'm happy. Thank you.

22
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,801
Also, your clothes look really good on you too.

23
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:25,403
It's a nice look.

24
00:02:27,138 --> 00:02:28,306
It's wonderful.

25
00:02:32,177 --> 00:02:34,746
Right then. Shall we get going?

26
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:42,454
But, before that... my hand feels kind of lonely.

27
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:50,362
My hand might get cold if I leave it like this.

28
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:53,364
Mhm.

29
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:56,534
This way, my hand won't get cold, it seems.

30
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:05,509
How many times does this make that we've held hands?

31
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:12,483
Even though this isn't the first time, my heart always pounds.

32
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:15,186
What about you?

33
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,923
How do you feel?

34
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:24,395
I see. The same as me.

35
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:29,867
Well then, let's go.

36
00:03:31,235 --> 00:03:33,704
It looks like today will be a fun day.
