1
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:18,778
Wow!

2
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:23,983
This is Sweets Island, the place I've only dreamed of!

3
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:31,291
I've wanted to come here for so long, and now my dream is finally coming true.

4
00:00:32,492 --> 00:00:37,664
I'm sure I'll never forget this wonderful day.

5
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:42,368
What's wrong? You're spacing out.

6
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,004
Huh?

7
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,941
You don't know about Sweets Island?

8
00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:57,483
Sweets Island, just like the name suggests, is an amusement park themed around sweets!

9
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:00,753
A spinning swing ride shaped like donuts,

10
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:06,192
a merry-go-round shaped like a cake, a Ferris wheel shaped like cream puffs...

11
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:09,829
There are attractions modeled after various sweets.

12
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:15,335
It's full of dreams and playfulness, isn't it interesting?

13
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:22,775
Also, there's a special service unique to Sweets Island that other amusement parks don't have.

14
00:01:23,977 --> 00:01:29,449
After enjoying an attraction, you get to taste sweets!

15
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:37,223
For example, if you ride the donut-shaped spinning swing, you can buy donuts afterward.

16
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:43,596
For the merry-go-round, it's cake. For the Ferris wheel, it's cream puffs.

17
00:01:45,298 --> 00:01:49,903
Just like that, various sweets are prepared for each attraction.

18
00:01:51,304 --> 00:01:53,873
And what's more, they aren't just any sweets!

19
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:57,510
Raw(?) donuts with dutch(?)berry sauce, 

20
00:01:57,911 --> 00:02:02,082
White chocolate Sachertorte, baked apple cream puffs...

21
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:08,655
Each and every one is a limited-edition sweet that you can only taste at Sweets Island!

22
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:17,297
Limited-edition sweets... What a wonderful sound.

23
00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:20,467
My dreams are expanding!

24
00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:24,304
I wonder what they taste like?

25
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:34,414
The pamphlet says they are gentle-tasting sweets made with the best ingredients... Just imagining it makes my heart flutter!

26
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:38,551
Oh?

27
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:41,955
Why are you chuckling?

28
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:46,192
"So earnest," you say...

29
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,530
Am I getting too carried away?

30
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:57,570
I was really looking forward to today, so I guess I got a bit lost in the moment.

31
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:01,641
It's kind of embarrassing.

32
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:07,080
You think I'm cute?

33
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:14,354
Hearing you say that makes me even more embarrassed.

34
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:21,828
But... hearing that from someone I like makes me really happy after all.

35
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:28,301
Well then, shall we go check out the attractions?

36
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:38,378
You're right. Since there are a lot of people, it looks like we'll have to wait for a long time.

37
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:47,687
Sweets Island has been super popular ever since it opened, and depending on the attraction, I think we'll have to wait quite a bit.

38
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:51,824
Are you bad at waiting?

39
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:59,298
Yeah, I know. There aren't many people who like waiting, right?

40
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:04,470
But, I'm relatively okay with it.

41
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:11,277
Like I said earlier, while waiting, you can have fun imagining various things, right?

42
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:17,683
Also, while waiting, sometimes they give out samples of the limited-edition sweets.

43
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:23,456
If we chat while eating those, the waiting time will fly by!

44
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:28,461
Come on, let's go!
